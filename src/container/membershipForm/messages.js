    Release of Liability, Indemnity Aggrement and Assumption of Risk
  </h3>
  <p>
     I understand that this release of liability, indemnity agreement, and
     assumption of risk is designed to indemnify and hold harmless the
     following people and entities: The CRUX corporation and any board member
     or officer of the corporation who currently holds or held that position at
     the time of a legal claim against them or the CRUX corporation. These
     protected parties shall hereinafter be referred to as the “leaders.” All
     individuals signing this agreement, not falling into the classification of
     leaders, shall be referred to hereinafter as “participant.” The phrase
     “participants” shall also include not only the signer, but also their
     spouse, heirs, estate, family members, and legal guardians or
     representatives, who shall also be bound by the terms of this agreement.
  </p>
  <p>
    This agreement is made in contemplation of all “climbing activities”,
    including, but not limited to, hiking, climbing, crash pad placement,
    belaying, rappelling, bouldering, spotting, setting up anchors, and placing
    and removing protective gear; head injuries; sprained or broken bones;
    poisonous snakes, plants and/or animals; dehydration; hypothermia; injury
    due to the negligence of myself and/or others; failure of fixed bolts,
    pitons, or climbing equipment; falling onto improperly placed and/or faulty
    protection; improperly tied knots or buckled harnesses; and improper rope,
    belay, or jumar technique. Hazards from weather and geophysical conditions
    and terrain of all types, stable and unstable, surface and subsurface
    conditions, being hit by falling rocks, equipment, climbers or other
    debris; hazards from all waters, moving or not, both above and below
    ground, the presence of others who also may be engaging in activities in
    any given location acting singly, in groups, motorized and not, and the
    continual recreational activities including but not limited to, walking,
    hiking, rock climbing, mountain biking, picnicking, camping, swimming and
    all other social and recreational activities. I understand that the
    aforementioned hazards and risks are described by the way of example only,
    and that there are numerous other hazards and risks inherent in rock
    climbing, bouldering, rappelling and hiking. I also understand that any of
    the injuries described above are not limited to the activity of rock
    climbing, bouldering, rappelling but may also occur hiking on any of the
    trails or roads leading up to the location of the aforementioned
    activities. This agreement shall also cover “social activities”, including,
    but not limited to, consumption of food and alcohol with group members and
    the potential for personal injury on private or public property due to
    uneven terrain, wood splinters, faulty construction/ maintenance, or the
    negligent actions of participants, leaders, or third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    This group is organized for the purpose of social interaction. Although the
    leaders will be present and climbing with or near other participants, each
    individual participant is responsible for their own safety and will not be
    supervised or advised by other leaders. I understand that the camping
    areas, roads, hiking trails and the bolts and pitons and fixed climbing
    protection on climbing routes are not maintained. I understand that there
    are other hidden or obvious, natural or unnatural, DANGEROUS conditions
    associated with rock climbing, and I understand and agree that CRUX and
    it’s leaders have no duty to inform me of these conditions; every
    participant defined in “parties included” accepts responsibility for having
    the knowledge necessary to participate in all group activities safely.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hereby release the leaders from any and all liability, claims, demands,
    or action that I may have for injuries arising out of my climbing
    activities or social activities, even if caused by negligence or other
    fault by the leaders.
  </p>
  <p>
     I further agree that I will not sue or make claim against the leaders for
     damages or other losses sustained as a result of my climbing activities or
     social activities, even if caused by negligence or other fault by the
     leaders. If a lawsuit or other legal action is commenced by the
     participant, the participant then further agrees to pay any and all
     attorney fees and costs in favor of the leaders. The participant also
     specifically waives any relief via attachment or preliminary injunction.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also agree to indemnify and hold harmless the leaders from all claims,
    judgments, costs, and attorney fees or other fees/costs incurred by the
    leaders in connection with any action brought by as a result of my
    participation in climbing activities or social activities.
  </p>
  <p>
     I understand that climbing activities are inherently dangerous. I
     expressly and voluntarily assume all risk of personal injury or death
     while participating in climbing activities whether or not caused by the
     negligence or other fault of the leaders, including, but not limited to,
     belayer error, improper protection placement, improper anchor placement,
     equipment malfunction for whatever cause, inadequate training, rescue
     attempts, or any other injury I may sustain, even if caused by negligence
     or other fault by the leaders.
  </p>
  <p>
     I assume all financial liability while participating in climbing
     activities or social activities whether or not caused by the negligence or
     other fault of the leaders, for any medical expenses or damages to any
     third parties person, property, or equipment, or to myself.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is my understanding and intention that this release and agreement be
    binding not only on myself, but on anyone or any entity, including my
    estate, heirs, assigns, family, agents or others who may be able to or does
    sue because of my injury or death. It is further my understanding and
    agreement that this release is intended to and does release the leaders
    from any and all claims or obligations whatsoever arising in any way from
    my participation in climbing activities or social activities, even if
    caused by negligence or other fault by the leaders.
  </p>
  <p>
     None of the leaders make any implied or express warranty as to the
     structural fitness of any climbing gear used by them, present on routes,
     or lent to participants or other third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
     I agree that if any portions of this release and agreement are found to be
     unenforceable or against public policy, that only that portion shall fail;
     the contract as a whole shall survive. I further specifically waive any
     un-enforceability or any public policy argument that I may make or that
     may be made on behalf of my estate or by anyone who would sue because of
     my injury or death.
  </p>
