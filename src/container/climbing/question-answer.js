  question: <span>How do I attend an event?</span>,
  answer: <div>
		<p>
			First things first, when attend one of our indoor climbing events
			is checking in with our partner gym. If you've never been to the gym
			before, the staff will ask you to fill out a waiver to enter the
			climbing area. Once your waiver is filled out, you can check-in with
			the front desk and pay for your day pass. Make sure to mention
			you're climbing with CRUX to get our discount!
		</p>
		<p>
			All CRUX event are headed by CRUX Hosts - friendly members of the
			CRUX community who are on hand to assist during our events. Once
			you've entered the gym, be on the look-out for these friendly faces,
			and stop by to say hi before the event begins. They're usually near
			the front of the gym, either by the CRUX banner or our rainbow and
			trans flags. You'll know it's them by their blue and yellow Team
			CRUX shirts.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're climbing with us during a Newbie Night, our head host will
			ask you to fill out a name tag and pair you up with one or two other
			hosts who will be your guides for the evening. If you're an
			experienced climber attending a Newbie Night, let our hosts know,
			they can help introduce you to other climbers and find a belay partner
			if you want to climb on ropes.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're climbing with us during one of our weekly events, hosts can
			help introduce you to other CRUXers, assist in finding you a climbing
			buddy, or simply be a friendly face if you have any questions during
			the evening.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the conclusion of every CRUX event members go out to eat, drink, and
			socialize. Ask your host for details if you're interested in attending.

	question: <span>What gear do I need?</span>,
	answer: <div>
		<p>
			<strong>Climbing</strong> shoes are a special shoe designed to fit
			snugly with an outsole of soft rubber for gripping footholds on the
			wall. <strong>Chalk</strong> is optional, but helps keep hands dry
			and improve grip on the rock. A climbing harness is required for any
			form of roped climbing (TR/Lead), it's how you'll tie into a rope and
			what will catch you if you fall.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you’re new to climbing, all this equipment can be rented at the gym.
			If you’re climbing with us at BKBoulders, rental gear is included in the
			price of your day pass.
